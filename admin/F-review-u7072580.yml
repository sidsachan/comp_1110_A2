comments:
  - Code structure is quite logically.
  - It is easy to follow because of the comments.
  - In part when already played positions are removed (Metro class, lines 460-469), we may try with Collection.contains or somethig instead of the loop.
  - Conditions checked in isPlacementSequenceValid() are easily understandable.
  - It might be helpful to make a helper function which just checks the validity of the last added tile assuming that placementSequence before that is valid.
  - This may help in improving the speed especially towards end of the game when placementSequence is long.
