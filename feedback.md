## Tutor Comment

Very good! Thanks for your efforts on this assignment. Your game runs smoothly from the jar file with all the basic functions, and follows the game rules.

For object-oriented features, you have several reasonable selected classes, but they could be better implemented and used. 
Most part of the solution still mainly relies on the manipulation of strings, you may consider how you could decode the strings into 
objects and then deal with the objects. Some parts of your solution appears to be hard coding, which could be avoided.

It is good that you add docstrings to all the non-trivial methods describing the functionalities; 
I suggest that you comment a bit more to your code to explain the logic, using the language that all the group members can understand.

For the GUI design, the game application is friendly and intuitive to use. It is nice that you highlight the nearest position and indicate whether it is valid using different colors, 
which extends what you learnt from the labs. I like the animation effect you give to the tiles placed by computer players. 
It is also good that you have a restart button and a pop-up window asking for confirmation.

It is required that you should use JDK 13 in your assignment so that it can be run on the lab machine, however JDK 11 is used in this work, which caused compiling failure, unfortunately. 
I manually fixed it to test your code. 0.25 marks are decducted for this.
