The code you wrote for the GUI part of the Metro game is clean, well-formatted and well-commented. The function you implement works properly. 
I really like the idea that players can customize their names before starting the game. 

The test you wrote for sortedOccurrence() method has a good code coverage. And you considered a reasonable range of test cases. 
It is also nice that you provide error messages in your tests.
