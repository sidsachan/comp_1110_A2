comments:

Your code is clean and well-formatted, which generates a valid but random move. You could consider optimizing your solution to make it more efficient. 
It would be nice if you could comment a bit more to your code. Although you provide 30 *lines* of code, I find that it contains slightly less than 20 *statements*.

It is nice that you create a good amount of test cases and add all the board information you need to Utilities.java, which gives a good structure to your test code. 
Please move those code you added to Utilities.java to another class later, because we want the provided test class to remain unchanged. 
The test code you listed in the admin file is not a complete version of the test.
